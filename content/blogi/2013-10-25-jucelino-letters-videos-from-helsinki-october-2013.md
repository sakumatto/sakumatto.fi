Jucelino Nóbrega da Luz and Ann Kristin Espefjord visited Helsinki in October 2013. They made presentations in Lahti and Helsinki and i had the privilege of also interviewing Jucelino. Out of that week-end a lot of video material was accumulated. That material is available here. **At the bottom of the page, please click one of the button in order to share this important information as widely as possible!**

&nbsp;

Video 1, **Ann Kristin Espefjord introduces the Brasilian dreamer, Jucelino da Luz**. Jucelino has sent over 99,000 letters that are based on his dreams. Espefjord is a journalist who has gone to the extent of verifying some of those letters as fully authentic. So the question is obvious: how can eg. a dream in 1998 and a letter based on that dream that was sent to the Norwegian embassy in Brasil contain specific information about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Utøya tragedy</a> of 2011, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombings" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boston marathon terror attack of 2013</a> and many more such seemingly impossible predictions. See for yourself.

Video 2,  **The Brasilian dreamer, Jucelino da Luz**. Jucelino has sent over 99,000 letters that are based on his dreams. In this video he clearly states that we do not have until 2020 to cut C=2 emissions. In fact, he states, by 2021–2023 we might experience temperatures of 63 C, if we do not react. His message is of hope and of mutual responsibility and yet in his voice there is an urgency that can not be neglected. See below for yourself.
